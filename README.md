1.High Level Solution:

Given 24 hours to make a login page with a chat window operating fully from the front end perspective requires alot more thinking process, so in order to meet with the challenge, I designed a basic login page and a chat window where the user can see his or her friends at the center of horizontally scrolling block and which ever friend is selected the chat relating to that friend pops up.
I decided to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the chat application such that the all the chat logs are being saved in the local storage at run time which gives the feel that the data is being saved and displayed at run time.
My reason was to solely meet the challenge with my fullest potential and for that I didn't use any boiler plate or any ready made templates.

2.Unit Tests:

I have made three basic unit test in which two are regarding the chat logs and one is testing the logout feature.
To run the test 
	i) nodemon or npm start
	ii)http://localhost:3000/test/
	
5. 
	i) The time spent on the challenge:
										Approximately 10 hours.
										
	ii)Changes in the submission to make it production ready:
										Work has to be done to make these two pages production ready such as data encryption and adding registration module and reset password module to complete the authentication feature.
										
	iii)What could I do differently if I had more time?
										Definitely I would have made the front end alot more appealing by adding animation and changing few css code as well.
